# teleprompter
A small website to communicate with a telepromter from remote. 


## Origin & Credits
The project mainly base on the [feather-js chat demo](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers). We use mongo instead of netDB and changed the behaviour of the frontend. But most of the credits goes to [feathersjs](https://github.com/feathersjs)
